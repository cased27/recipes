# Recipes

Purpose:
* Practice my JS skills using methods, creating functions, event listeners, etc
* Have a place to put my new recipes! Since COVID I started cooking more and found a number of recipes that I've used over and over again. Now I have access to them on the web
* a simple recipe webpage with no frills; no ads, no videos, no pics, no stories. Just the stuff you need to make the dish.

Outcome:
Although the page, in all respects, is quite boring I really wanted to keep it super simple and straight forward as far as the appearance came. I was able to reinforce a lot of the JS skills I've been learning in my course with Colt Steele and now I have a place to access my recipes easy.
