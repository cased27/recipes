# Recipes

Purpose:
* Practice my JS skills using methods, creating functions, event listeners, etc
* Have a place to put my new recipes! Since COVID I started cooking more and found a number of recipes that I've used over and over again. Now I have access to them on the web
* a simple recipe webpage with no frills; no ads, no videos, no pics, no stories. Just the stuff you need to make the dish.

Outcome:
Although the page is quite boring I really wanted to keep it super simple and straight forward as far as the appearance came. In addition, my main focus was to reinforce JS skills and organize my scattered recipes. I was able to accomplish both my goals with this project.
